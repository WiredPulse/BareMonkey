# BareMonkey
Volatility plugin parser


# Description of Project

Bare Monkey was developed to help expedite my forensics analysis using Volatility. With the creation of Bare Monkey, one can run all possible plug-ins against a memory capture using Volatility and anything not returning anything, will be deleted. After the program runs, the data can be parsed quickly and without Volatility.

#Execution
This script needs Volatility in order to run successfully.

- Use the following to run the script:

./bare_monkey.sh


Occasionally, you need to modify the permissions: chmod 711 ./bare_monkey.sh

Finally, follow the prompts at the beginning of the script!

# Notes <br>

This script is intended to be used for memory anaylsis.
