![Alt text](https://github.com/WiredPulse/BareMonkey/blob/master/bare_monkey.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

# Description of Project

Bare Monkey was developed to help expedite my forensics analysis using Volatility. With the creation of Bare Monkey, one can run all possible plug-ins against a memory capture using Volatility and anything not returning anything, will be deleted. After the program runs, the data can be parsed quickly and without Volatility.

#Execution
This script needs Volatility in order to run successfully.

- Use the following to run the script:<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;./bare_monkey.sh <br>


- Occasionally, you need to modify the permissions: chmod 711 ./bare_monkey.sh

- Finally, follow the prompts at the beginning of the script!

# Notes <br>

This script is intended to be used for memory anaylsis using Volatility.
